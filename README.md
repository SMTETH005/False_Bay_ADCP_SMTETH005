# False_Bay_ADCP_SMTETH005
Repository containing the processing scripts, data, and project document. This was for completion of a BSc Hons. in ocean and atmosphere science at the University of Cape Town. 

A clear understanding of past, present and future ocean conditions is essential for effective coastal management and planning. False Bay, a large embayment on South Africa’s southwest coast, exhibits a complex hydrodynamic environment, yet observations of its physical oceanography remain sparse. This study addresses the critical lack of accessible time-series data by adapting an open-source workflow to process and recover archival Teledyne RDI Workhorse acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) datasets collected between 2014 and 2017. A reusable processing and visualisation pipeline was developed and applied to ten deployments – three at Gordon’s Bay and seven at Kogel Bay – producing self-describing NetCDF datasets and standardised plots for each deployment. The approach was demonstrated through a case study integrating ADCP-derived current and wave observations with ERA5 and WASA3 wind reanalysis data to illustrate potential applications in operational oceanography, including high-frequency process studies and model validation. The results highlight the value of open-source tools for extending the research utility of underused datasets and reducing reliance on costly and outdated proprietary software.
